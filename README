This code takes a file of data and a definition and turns it into a gdoc spreadsheet with formulas.

You need to have http://code.google.com/p/gdata-python-client/ available. Full instructions for
installing using and testing are here: http://code.google.com/apis/gdata/articles/python_client_lib.html

Usage:

./deserialise2gdoc.py --user username -pw password

Note: at present the programme will find the first spreadsheet in your google account and start overwriting it, so best create a new one or better still use it on a google account you don't rely on for anything else!

To do:
- create class to hold the structure and separate the gdoc code from that
- full alphabet
- option to create or specify existing spreadsheet

Subject to AB's schema
- allow arbitrary number of data, user, algo rows

Idea:
Four types data to help specify the computation (like cols in a spreadsheet)
* choices: values that describe each row (like drilldowns), e.g. manufacturer and model of car
* data: this has a given value (like a data item value), e.g. kgCO2/km
* user: this can be set by the user (like a profile item value), e.g. distance
* algo: this is a value computed by a formula from arithmetic operations on data, user and possibly other algos

By chaining algos together a series of steps in an operation can be set out. As viewed in spreadsheet this is just series of columns with formulas.
